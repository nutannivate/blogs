#+DESCRIPTION: How to swap internal and external memory on Android
#+LANGUAGE:  en

** Why increase the internal memory?
   Android device comes with limited internal memory. This internal
   memory may soon get consumed by installed application and other
   media. Soon there is no space left for new applications and you
   are out of your phone's memory.

** What can we do to increase this space?
   Most Android device can support external micro-SD card up to
   32GB. Developers have figured out a way to swap the internal memory
   with the micro-SD card. This can extend phone internal memory to a
   size on external SD-card. Conversely the internal memory will then
   be treated as the external memory for all media.
	
** Devices with a Swap Memory Mod
   First, you need to download a =zip= file for your Android device.
   Although most Android devices with external memory support swap
   between memory but not all. Also you need a rooted device.

   Follow these steps:

   - Copy =.zip= file onto your external SD.
   - Go into recovery mode.
   - Flash the =.zip=
   - Reboot and you are done.
