#+DESCRIPTION: How to pull or extract an installed apk from android device
#+LANGUAGE:  en

** Follow the steps to pull or extract an installed apk from android device. This works on 'rooted' as well as un-rooted device.
   - Determine the package name of the application. The naming
     convention is "com.organization-name.app-name", for
     e.g. "com.android.gtalk". Type:
     #+begin_src sh
       adb shell pm list packages
     #+end_src

     Look through the list of package names and try to find a match
     between the app name and the package name. This should be simple
     in most cases, but sometimes the package name can be completely
     unrelated to the app name. In such case visit the app on
     [[https://play.google.com][play.google.com]] and scan the URL. For example in the URL
     [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Dcom.kiloo.subwaysurf&hl%3Den][https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiloo.subwaysurf&hl=en]],
     the package name is /com.kiloo.subwaysurf/.

   - Now get the full path of the APK file using:
     #+begin_src sh
       adb shell pm path com.example.someapp
     #+end_src

    The output will look something like this: 
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       package:/data/app/com.example.someapp-2.apk
     #+END_SRC sh

   - Pull the APK file from the Android device using:
     #+begin_src sh
       adb pull /data/app/com.example.someapp-2.apk
     #+end_src
